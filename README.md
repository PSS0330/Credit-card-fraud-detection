Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a robust fraud detection model for the banking sector, addressing ethical challenges and the technical difficulty of imbalanced datasets. The goal is to create an efficient approach to identify fraudulent transactions using consumers' transaction history.

Objectives:
Develop a predictive model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions.
Address the issue of imbalanced datasets to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability.
Compare and analyze various machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing models.
Employ a fusion method to combine top-performing classifiers based on key performance metrics.

Algorithms and Techniques Used:
Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Random Forest Classifier
Fusion Model (a combination of best-performing classifiers)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDClassifier)

Handling Imbalanced Datasets:
Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE): Used to balance the dataset by oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions), ensuring that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset.

Key Performance Metrics:
Accuracy
F1-score
Area Under the Curve (AUC)
Precision
Recall

Methodology:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess transaction data, including cleaning and normalization.
SMOTE Application: Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using the key metrics.
Fusion Approach: Combine the top-performing models based on the evaluation metrics to create a fusion model.
Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of individual models against the fusion model.
Ethical Considerations: Discuss the ethical implications of fraud detection in the financial sector, ensuring the model adheres to ethical standards.

Results:
The fusion model, which combines the strengths of selected classifiers, outperforms individual algorithms in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, AUC, Precision, and Recall.
The approach provides a robust and efficient tool for detecting credit card fraud, contributing to the improvement of fraud detection mechanisms in the financial sector.

Conclusion:
The study successfully develops a robust fraud detection model by leveraging a fusion-based approach and extensive comparison analysis.
The use of SMOTE to address dataset imbalance and the ethical considerations highlighted in the study underscore the importance of a comprehensive approach to developing predictive models in the banking sector.
